# cepheus_manager
Intended to run all the various moving parts of the Cepheus RPG from the command line




# Useful Functions:
hire_crew() - walks the user through adding a crew member (player or NPC) step by step. Easier than using the direct add_crew_member() function, which requires input for all lines.
